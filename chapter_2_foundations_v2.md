# Chapter 2 — Foundations: Bits, Phase, Energy, and the Birth of Structure (Revised + Completed)

## 1. From Nothing to Level‑0 Bits
A **Level‑0 bit** is the simplest possible form of existence. It has:
- existence,
- a minimal internal time (its own sequence of states),
- an internal phase that rotates steadily.

Bits may begin or cease to exist, but have no other intrinsic transitions. At this stage, no geometry or shared time exists.

**Every bit carries exactly one external horizontal connector** that can form or dissolve bonds. This rule is foundational for all later connector-counting.

---

## 2. Horizontal Connections and Shared Time
Bits may form **horizontal connections** that:
1. couple their internal time steps, creating a shared temporal ordering,
2. synchronize their rotation rates (not absolute phases),
3. preserve a fixed internal phase offset between them.

When connected, each bit still conceptually retains its single external connector, but it is temporarily occupied by the bond.

Without closed structure, direction of phase rotation is meaningless.

---

## 3. Level‑1 Compounds: Pairs
A stable horizontal connection yields a **pair**, a Level‑1 compound. A pair has:
- its own internal time,
- a single external phase shared by the compound,
- an internal phase offset inherited from its two bits.

### Universal Rule: Internal Horizontal Dissolution
When a compound forms:
- The internal horizontal bond between its constituent bits dissolves.
- It is replaced by **vertical links** from each bit to the compound.
- Each constituent bit regains its **one free horizontal port** for external bonding.

### Redundancy Pressure (Global Rule)
Whenever two bits become vertically connected through a compound, retaining their earlier horizontal bond becomes redundant. Redundant horizontals tend to dissolve. This rule applies at all levels.

---

## 4. From Chains to Loops
Pairs may connect through their external horizontal ports to form chains or **closed cycles**. Closed cycles are precursors to Level‑2 structures.

---

## 5. Level‑2 Compounds: Loops
When pairs connect cyclically, a **loop** forms.

### Dissolution Tendency (Not Automatic)
For loops:
- some internal horizontals are redundant and dissolve,
- others may temporarily persist,
- larger loops may retain partial structure.

The same redundancy rule applies: any horizontal bond whose endpoints are already connected vertically through the compound tends to dissolve.

### Connector Count Rule
Since each bit always has one external horizontal connector, a compound’s external connector count is:

**number of bits − 2 × (number of remaining internal horizontal bonds)**.

This rule explains:
- why **3‑loops** have exactly 6 external connectors (all horizontals dissolve),
- why larger loops may have more or fewer external ports depending on which horizontals remain.

### Phase Inheritance Rule
A loop, like any compound, inherits:
1. a **single external phase**,
2. fixed internal phase offsets (becoming structural features),
3. synchronized rotation rate among its bits.

---

## 6. The Special Role of the 3‑Loop
The **3‑loop** (three pairs in a cycle) is structurally unique:
- all internal horizontals dissolve under redundancy pressure,
- it has exactly **6 external connectors**, one from each constituent bit,
- it has **no internal degrees of freedom**, including no twist modes,
- it is the smallest loop that produces meaningful closed-cycle phase structure.

These properties make the 3‑loop the fundamental building block for larger structures (developed in later chapters).

---

## 7. Higher Loops (Minimal Introduction)
Larger loops (4‑loops, 5‑loops, etc.) exist. Only minimal facts are required here:
- larger loops may retain internal horizontals,
- some are stable, others unstable,
- their connector counts depend on the general counting rule above.

Their specific roles in physics appear in later chapters.

---

## 8. Phase Becomes Geometric Only in Loops
Phase offsets around a closed cycle can accumulate into a **winding number**. This is impossible for bits and pairs.

Thus loops introduce the first meaningful form of:
- chirality,
- twist,
- handedness,
- and other geometric phase structures.

These become the seeds of charge, helicity, and spin in later chapters.

---

## 9. Energy as Structural and Phase Strain
Energy is understood as **total strain** in a compound:
- **geometric strain** in connector configuration,
- **phase strain** arising from synchronization pressures and internal offsets.

This unifies kinetic, potential, and field‑like energy as forms of structural tension or mismatch.

---

## 10. Unified Compounds and External Action
A compound:
- has its own internal time,
- its own external phase,
- unified identity independent of constituents.

But:
> **A compound never acts directly. All physical interaction occurs only through the external horizontal ports of its constituent bits.**

This guarantees locality and prevents emergent higher-level “forces” unrelated to bit-level structure.

---

## 11. Summary of Foundational Rules
1. Level‑0 bits have internal time, phase, and exactly one horizontal port.
2. Horizontal connections synchronize rotation rates and create shared time.
3. Compounds form by dissolving redundant internal horizontals and binding vertically.
4. The global redundancy rule guides dissolution at all levels.
5. Connector count: external connectors = bits − 2×(remaining horizontals).
6. Compounds inherit one external phase; internal offsets become structure.
7. Chirality/winding meaningful only in loops.
8. Energy = geometric strain + phase strain.
9. Compounds act only through constituent bits.

This chapter completes the foundation for all later development.
