# Chapter 1 — Predictions

This chapter lists the model’s predictions entirely in the language of standard physics, without referencing any new internal concepts introduced later. The aim is to state clear, testable claims using only familiar physical terms.

## 1. Structure of Space and Fields
- Space is discrete at extremely small scales and consists of a three-dimensional cubic lattice of nodes.
- Each node has exactly six nearest neighbors (±x, ±y, ±z).
- All known physical fields arise as different patterns of deformation or oscillation of this underlying lattice.
- No continuous spacetime manifold exists below a fundamental length scale on the order of the Planck length.

## 2. Photons and Electromagnetism
- A single photon corresponds to a fixed 12-point geometric configuration (an icosahedral shell) propagating through the lattice.
- Multiple photons occupying the same mode correspond to multiple shells stacked in the same region.
- Photons have exactly two helicity states (+1 and −1).
- Electromagnetic waves propagate through lattice oscillations that remain perfectly spherical at large scales.
- There exists a maximum possible photon frequency.
- Photon energy deviates from E = hν at very high frequencies.

## 3. Matter
- Electrons and positrons are stable, localized distortions of the underlying lattice.
- Annihilation of an electron–positron pair produces photons whose total energy equals their rest mass plus kinetic energy.
- Neutrinos correspond to minimal lattice distortions, explaining their tiny mass and weak interactions.
- Neutrinos have three internal modes which oscillate during propagation.
- Quarks correspond to asymmetric distortions that cannot exist in isolation.
- Heavier leptons and quarks are unstable, energized versions of the same basic distortions.

## 4. Forces and Interactions
- Gravity arises from long-range deformations of the lattice caused by concentrated energy or mass.
- Electric charge corresponds to a local rotational distortion with two possible orientations.
- Opposite charges annihilate when brought together, releasing energy as photons.
- Strong forces arise from binding rules between asymmetric distortions.
- Weak interactions arise from rare reconfigurations affecting the internal state of distortions.

## 5. Quantum Behavior
- Wave–particle duality emerges from the difference between delocalized lattice oscillations and localized stable distortion patterns.
- Interference arises from linear superposition of lattice oscillations.
- Quantum collapse corresponds to a transition from a delocalized oscillation to a permanently localized distortion.
- Fermionic vs. bosonic behavior depends on whether distortions can share lattice sites or must occupy distinct neighborhoods.

## 6. Universal Limits
- There exists a minimum length scale near the Planck length.
- There exists a minimum time scale near the Planck time.
- These imply a maximum photon frequency, a maximum energy density, and slight deviations from smooth spacetime at extreme scales.

## 7. Large-Scale Predictions
- Relativistic effects arise from the propagation rules of the lattice.
- Extremely high-density photon gases undergo gravitational collapse at lower thresholds than in continuous spacetime.
- Cosmological evolution reflects large-scale deformation patterns rather than a smooth spacetime continuum.
