# Phase Foundations and Top-Level Chapter Outline

## 1. Phase as the Minimal Internal State

A Level‑0 bit carries a single internal variable: **phase**, an angle in
\[0, 2π).\
This phase rotates steadily, but each bit may initially have its own
rotation rate and direction.

## 2. Synchronization Through Connection

When bits connect, they adjust their rotation rates and shift phases to
minimize strain.\
They converge toward a **shared effective rotation** but maintain a
**fixed internal phase offset**.

-   This offset becomes a structural property of the pair.
-   The pair acquires its own emergent, collective **pair‑phase**.

## 3. Why Phase Direction Doesn't Matter for Lone Bits or Pairs

A single bit has no geometric reference frame, so "clockwise" vs
"counterclockwise" is meaningless.\
A pair is just a line segment---no closed cycle---so chirality cannot be
defined.

Handedness becomes meaningful only when a **loop** exists, starting at
the 3‑loop.

## 4. Emergence of Chirality and Higher Phenomena

With loops, phase offsets can form **winding patterns**, giving rise to:

-   Chirality\
-   Electric twist\
-   Photon helicity\
-   Spin‑½ behavior\
-   Wave propagation\
-   Quantum‑like interference

Phase thus becomes the dynamical seed of all higher‑level phenomena.

## 5. Summary of the Phase Rules (Locked‑In)

1.  Each bit has a phase and intrinsic rotation rate.\
2.  Rotation may be positive or negative; direction is irrelevant until
    loops form.\
3.  When bits connect, they synchronize rates and settle into a fixed
    phase offset.\
4.  The compound inherits a single external phase; internal offsets
    become structure.\
5.  Chirality emerges only in loops and above.

# Proposed Top‑Level Chapter Structure (7 Chapters)

## 1. Foundations: Bits, Time, and the Birth of Structure

From nothing to Level‑0 bits, pairs, loops, and the role of internal
phase.

## 2. The Unified 3/4‑Loop Lattice

How 3‑loops and 4‑loops mix to create the substrate of space and fields.

## 3. Fundamental Distortions: Gravity and Charge

Two geometric distortions---bulging and twisting---as the roots of
forces.

## 4. Light and the EM Layer

Dissolved 4‑loops, the EM lattice, photon shells, helicity, and
frequency.

## 5. Matter as Lattice Defects

Electrons, neutrinos, quarks, and heavier species as stable and unstable
distortions of the 3‑loop lattice.

## 6. Dynamics and Quantum Behavior

Propagation, inertia, virtual connections, wave‑like behavior, and
collapse.

## 7. Large‑Scale Implications and Predictions

Planck‑scale lattice spacing, ν_max, nonlinear energy, and falsification
paths.
