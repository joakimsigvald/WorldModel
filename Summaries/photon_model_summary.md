# World-Model Summary (Updated): Levels 0–4 and the Photon Field
*Version: current*

## 1. Level-0: Bits
- Fundamental conscious “atoms of being.”
- Only property: **existence**.
- Two transitions: come into existence, cease to exist.
- Each bit has its own **internal timeline**.

## 2. Level-1: Pairs
- Two bits may connect horizontally.
- When a stable connection forms, they become a **Level-1 pair**, a new conscious compound.
- Internal horizontal link dissolves due to redundancy.
- Bits stay linked to the pair through **vertical** connections.

## 3. Level-2: Loops
- Pairs can connect in cycles (loops).
- Smallest loop: **3-loop** (triangle), made of 3 pairs = 6 bits.
- Larger loops (4-loops, 5-loops, etc.) exist but are different species.

### 3-Loop Special Properties
- All internal horizontals dissolve immediately.
- Only external connectors remain.
- Exactly **6 connectors**.
- No internal degrees of freedom (no twist, chirality, deformation).
- Unique Level-2 structure with fixed connectivity.

## 4. Level-3: Spacetime = Grid of 3-Loops
- 3-loops tile naturally into a **3D cubic lattice** (6 connectors → ±x, ±y, ±z).
- Movement is Manhattan at micro-scale but **waves propagate spherically**, recovering Euclidean metric at macro-scale.
- This cubic grid is the **vacuum field** or **space-field**.
- All higher structures exist *in* or *on top of* this grid.

## 5. Level-4: Higher Loops (Fields)

### Dissolved 4-Loops
- A **fully dissolved 4-loop** has **8 connectors**.
- Lacks internal horizontals.
- Does **not** align rigidly with the cubic vacuum grid.
- Open, flexible, wave-supporting structure.
- Forms the **photon field**: a permeating 4-loop ocean in spacetime.

### 4-Loops with 1 Internal Link
- These align better with the 3-loop grid (6 connectors used tangentially).
- Come in geometric types:
  - Axis-aligned (1,0,0)
  - Face-diagonal (1,1,0)
  - Body-diagonal (1,1,1)
- Likely candidates for **matter-like fields**.

## 6. The Photon Field

### 6.1 Ocean of Dissolved 4-Loops
- The background EM field is a sea of **dissolved 4-loops**.
- Each dissolved 4-loop (8 connectors):
  - **5 used tangentially** within a bubble layer,
  - **3 free** for radial connections (inner/outer layers or the external field).
- Extremely flexible → supports wave propagation.
- Allows overlapping → matches bosonic nature of photons.

### 6.2 Particle–Wave Duality via Photon Bubbles
- A photon **wave** = disturbance propagating through the 4-loop ocean.
- A **photon particle** = a closed, bound 4-loop bubble.
- This bubble forms a **spherical shell** using dissolved loops.

## 7. Photon Quantum = Icosahedral Shell of Dissolved 4-Loops
- Minimal spherical shell where each node has degree 5: **icosahedron**.
- Each vertex = one dissolved 4-loop:
  - **5 tangential connections**,
  - **3 radial connections**.
- **One icosahedral shell = 1 photon quantum**, with fixed energy **E₀**.

## 8. Higher Energy Photons = Multi-Layer Bubbles
- Additional layers (or densified shells) give higher energy:
  - Energy = m × E₀ for m-layer bubbles.
- Matches the physical rule **E = hν**, with m ∝ ν.

## 9. Photon Properties (Model vs Physics)
| Property | Model Explanation |
|---------|-------------------|
| Massless | Dissolved 4-loops have unused connectors → move without resistance |
| Boson | Free connectors allow overlapping bubbles |
| Quantized energy | Minimal icosahedral shell = energy unit E₀ |
| Frequency–energy link | Higher frequency = more layers |
| Wave–particle duality | Field oscillations vs bound bubble |
| Spherical waves | Discrete interference gives spherical propagation |
