# Photon Model Update (Front-Heavy 3/4 Mixed Photon)

## 1. New Photon Topology (Locked-In Model)

We adopt the mixed 3+4 photon topology with **front-heavy 4-loop
hemisphere** and **3-loop apex in front**.\
This configuration will be considered the default photon model unless
contradicted.

### **Structure (12 loops total)**

-   **Front pole:** 1 × **3-loop**\
-   **Front ring:** 5 × **4-loops**\
-   **Back ring:** 5 × **3-loops**\
-   **Back pole:** 1 × **4-loop**

### Key Properties

-   The front hemisphere is **4-loop rich** → higher mobility → defines
    the **direction of motion**.
-   The 3-loop front pole acts as a **rigid bumper**, the 4-loop ring
    behind it is the **active driving surface**.
-   The photon still occupies **6 field sites**, same as earlier models.
-   Connector count remains balanced → **stacking is allowed** (multiple
    photons per mode).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Direction of Motion

The photon naturally travels **toward the 4-loop-rich hemisphere**:

> **Direction = front = where the 5×4-loop ring sits.**

The 3-loop pole in front does not prevent propagation but is not what
defines forward motion; the 4-loop ring behind it drives the structural
reconfiguration needed to "move."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Helicity

Helicity arises from **phase winding** around the front/back 5-rings:

-   Only winding numbers **w = +1** and **w = −1** create stable,
    propagating modes.
-   These correspond to **right- and left-handed helicity**,
    respectively.
-   The layout of 3-loops vs 4-loops does not change the count of
    helicity modes.
-   Reversing direction of motion reverses helicity (as in physics)
    because helicity = spin ⋅ direction.

Helicity depends on **ring phase twist**, not on which loop type leads.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Stacking and Overlap

-   Opposite-helicity photons can stack in a single lattice location
    (bosonic behavior).
-   Photons traveling in different directions can temporally overlap and
    pass through each other.
-   Stacking is possible because the shell removes as many free
    connectors as it adds.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Summary in One Sentence

**The photon is now a front-heavy 3+4 mixed icosahedral shell, with a
3-loop apex, a 4-loop-rich forward hemisphere that defines propagation,
and helicity given by ±1 winding of phase around the rings.**
