# Provisional Neutrino Model (Tetrahedron-Based)

## 1. Overview  
This chapter summarizes the provisional neutrino model developed in today’s session.  
The goal is to find a structural interpretation of neutrinos within the 3+4-loop lattice framework that is consistent with known neutrino properties, especially mass hierarchy, stability, and oscillations.

The current best candidate is:  
> **Neutrino = the smallest stable 3D matter distortion: a tetrahedral loop-structure.**

## 2. The Neutrino Shape  
A neutrino corresponds to **one discrete geometric shape**:

- A **tetrahedral cage** made of **4 loop-nodes**  
- Connected by **6 internal bonds**  
- The smallest closed 3D distortion that can exist in the lattice  
- Produces minimal bulge → tiny mass  
- Cannot be “eaten” by the lattice due to its 3D closure  
- Carries no twist → electrically neutral  

This tetrahedron is the **universal shape of all neutrinos**.

## 3. Loop Composition and the Three Neutrino Masses  
Each of the 4 nodes in the tetrahedron can be either:

- a **3-loop** (rigid, fewer connectors), or  
- a **4-loop** (looser, more connectors).

This generates exactly **three stable internal configurations**:

1. **(1×4-loop + 3×3-loops)** → Lightest → maps to **ν₁**  
2. **(2×4-loops + 2×3-loops)** → Middle → maps to **ν₂**  
3. **(3×4-loops + 1×3-loop)**  → Heaviest → maps to **ν₃**

Mass increases with number of 4-loops, because 4-loops introduce more connectors and strain.

### Key Result  
**These three configurations map cleanly to the three real neutrino mass eigenstates.**

## 4. Stability of Mass States  
A neutrino created in one configuration **remains in that configuration** during flight:

- ν₁ never becomes ν₂  
- ν₂ never becomes ν₃  
- ν₃ never becomes ν₁

The loop composition (1+3), (2+2), (3+1) is **fixed** for each neutrino.

This matches real physics: **mass states do not change in flight**.

---

## 5. Oscillation Mechanism  
Neutrino oscillation **does not** come from switching between mass configurations.

Instead, oscillation arises from **internal phase modes** of the tetrahedron:

- Each loop-node carries its own phase  
- The 4-node network is phase-coupled through 6 bonds  
- A tetrahedron with four oscillators always has exactly **three independent internal modes**  
- These correspond to ν₁, ν₂, ν₃  
- Their relative phase drift produces oscillation  

This structural mechanism matches real neutrino oscillation:

- Three frequencies (ω₁, ω₂, ω₃)  
- Stable in vacuum  
- Lorentz time-dilation → 1/E energy dependence  
- Oscillation persists even in perfect lattice regions

---

## 6. Natural Mixing Asymmetry  
The real PMNS mixing matrix has a distinctive asymmetry:

- Strong ν₁–ν₂ mixing  
- Medium ν₂–ν₃ mixing  
- Weak ν₁–ν₃ mixing

The tetrahedron reproduces this **qualitatively**:

- N₁ ↔ N₂ differ by **one node-type**  
- N₂ ↔ N₃ differ by **one node-type**  
- N₁ ↔ N₃ differ by **two node-types**

Thus the structural distance matches the observed mixing hierarchy:

- **One-node flips → strong/medium mixing**  
- **Two-node flips → weak mixing**

No fine-tuning required.

---

## 7. Neutrino Speed  
All neutrino types travel extremely close to the lattice update speed.  
But due to mass differences:

- ν₁ (1+3) → **fastest**  
- ν₂ (2+2) → mid  
- ν₃ (3+1) → **slowest**

Differences are tiny, consistent with observations.

## 8. Summary of the Provisional Neutrino Model  
- Neutrino = **tetrahedral defect**, smallest 3D matter shape  
- Three loop-compositions = **three mass states**  
- Mass states are fixed  
- Oscillation = **internal phase dynamics**, not shape change  
- Mixing asymmetry follows from loop-composition asymmetry  
- Speed hierarchy matches mass hierarchy  
- Entire picture is **compatible with real neutrino phenomenology** so far

This model is not yet fully confirmed, but **passes all qualitative tests** performed today.

## 9. Next Steps  
- Formalize internal phase-coupling and derive approximate mode frequencies  
- Check if Δω ratios match Δm² ratios in real data  
- Integrate neutrino model cleanly into the “Matter” chapter  
- Investigate why tetrahedron is the only minimal stable 3D distortion
