# Photon Stack Model – Current State (2025-11-17)

This document summarizes the current, refined picture of **4-loops, the EM-field, and photons** in the world‑model, including the new *stack model* for multiple photons in the same mode.

## 1. Ontology Refresher

### 1.1 Levels and Compounds

- **Level-0: Bits**
  - Fundamental entities with existence, internal time, and internal phase.
  - Bits can form horizontal connections to other bits.
  - When they become part of higher compounds, they remain connected vertically as constituents.

- **Level-1: Pairs**
  - Two bits that once had a horizontal bond form a **pair**.
  - Even if the original horizontal bond dissolves, the **Level-1 compound persists** via vertical links from both bits.
  - The pair carries its own internal time/phase and is a constituent of higher entities.

- **Level-2: Loops**
  - Loops are made of pairs arranged in cyclic structures.
  - We are currently focusing on **4-loops**.
  - Important: even when a loop is “fully dissolved,” its internal hierarchy remains:
    - bits → pairs → 4-loop, all connected by vertical links.

## 2. Fully Dissolved 4-Loops

### 2.1 Definition

- A **4-loop** (by default) means a **fully dissolved 4-loop**.
- Structure:
  - 4 pairs (Level-1)
  - 8 bits (Level-0)
  - All original internal **horizontal** loop-connections have dissolved.
- What remains:
  - Purely **vertical** hierarchy: bits → pairs → 4-loop.
  - Each bit still has **one external horizontal port**.
  - Therefore each 4-loop has **8 horizontal connectors** (one per bit).

### 2.2 Connector Types

For clarity, we distinguish:

- **Vertical links**: constituent relations (bits → pairs → 4-loop). Always present while the compound exists.
- **Horizontal connectors (ports)**: the 8 external ports on the bits, used for:
  - **Lattice bonds** inside the EM-field.
  - **Shell bonds** in a photon.
  - **Stack bonds** between photon shells.
  - **Free connectors** for interaction with other structures (matter, other photons, reconfiguration).

We never count vertical links as part of the “8 connectors.”

## 3. The EM-Field as a 4-Loop Lattice

### 3.1 Cubic Lattice of 4-Loops

- The EM-field is modeled as a **3D cubic lattice** of fully dissolved 4-loops.
- Each 4-loop in the EM-field acts as a lattice node and has:
  - **6 lattice bonds** to neighboring 4-loops:
    - ±x, ±y, ±z (Manhattan connectivity).
  - **2 free connectors**.
- Counting:  
  `6 (lattice bonds) + 2 (free) = 8 (total connectors)`

The field is thus **structurally saturated** spatially but still has capacity (2 free ports) for excitations and interactions.

### 3.2 No Extra “Downward” Binding to Space Yet

- 3-loops form the **space (Level-3) cubic grid**.
- 4-loops form the **EM-field (Level-4)** on/within this space.
- At this stage we **do not force** an additional one-to-one vertical bond between each EM 4-loop and a space 3-loop, because:
  - 3-loops already use their **6 connectors** to tile space.
  - Forcing an extra vertical bond would complicate the internal structure of space.
- Instead, we treat the EM-field as **living in** the space lattice without having a simple “one extra connector per 3-loop” constraint.

This keeps the model simpler for now.

## 4. Photon Shells: “The Shell *Is* the Photon”

### 4.1 Icosahedral Photon Shell

- A **single photon quantum** is identified with **one icosahedral shell** of dissolved 4-loops.
- Shell structure:
  - 12 dissolved 4-loops at the vertices of an icosahedron.
  - Each vertex in an icosahedron has degree 5 → **5 shell bonds** per 4-loop.
- Each 4-loop on the shell therefore uses:
  - **5 connectors** for shell bonds (internal to the shell).
  - The remaining **3 connectors** are used for:
    - Connection to the EM-field and/or
    - Connection to other shells and/or
    - Free interaction capacity.

### 4.2 One Shell = One Photon

- We explicitly adopt:
  - **One shell = one photon quantum.**
- A “multi-shell bubble” is therefore **not** a fatter single photon, but rather:
  - A **stack of multiple photons** occupying (approximately) the same region or mode.
- This aligns with standard quantum theory:
  - **More energy at the same frequency** = more photons, not a single high-energy photon with altered structure.

---

## 5. Stack Model of Multiple Photons

We now model multiple photons in the same mode as a **vertical stack of shells** sitting above an EM 4-loop.

### 5.1 Base EM 4-Loop

- Each EM 4-loop in the lattice has:
  - **6 lattice bonds** to other EM 4-loops.
  - **2 free connectors** in the absence of photons.
- When a stack of photon shells is attached:
  - **1 free connector** of the EM 4-loop is used to connect to the **base photon shell**.
  - The EM 4-loop still retains **1 remaining free connector**.

So with photons attached:
- EM 4-loop: `6 (lattice) + 1 (to photon stack) + 1 (free) = 8`

### 5.2 Single-Shell Photon (One Photon)

For a single shell sitting directly on the EM-field:

- Each shell 4-loop uses:
  - **5 shell bonds** (icosahedron geometry).
  - **1 bond down** to the underlying EM 4-loop.
  - **2 free connectors**.

Counting:  
`5 (shell) + 1 (to EM) + 2 (free) = 8`

Thus a **single photon** has, per 4-loop in the shell:

- 2 genuinely **free connectors**, matching the “2 free connectors” of a bare EM 4-loop.

### 5.3 Multi-Shell Stack (Multiple Photons)

A stack of multiple shells represents **multiple photons** co-located in the same EM region.

We adopt:

- **Base shell** (touching the EM 4-loop):
  - 5 shell bonds.
  - 1 bond **down** to the EM 4-loop.
  - 1 bond **up** to the shell above.
  - 1 free connector.  
  → `5 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8`

- **Interior shells** (if more than 2 shells):
  - 5 shell bonds.
  - 1 bond **down** to previous shell.
  - 1 bond **up** to next shell.
  - 1 free connector.  
  → `5 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8`

- **Top shell**:
  - 5 shell bonds.
  - 1 bond **down** to the shell below.
  - 2 free connectors.  
  → `5 + 1 + 2 = 8`

Properties:

- Each added shell (each additional photon) adds internal structure and **one extra free connector per 4-loop somewhere in the stack**.
- EM “footprint” does **not** scale with the number of shells:
  - Only **one EM 4-loop** is used as the base,
  - Only **one connector per EM 4-loop** is used to host the entire stack.

This captures the bosonic nature: many photons can occupy the same mode/region without linearly increasing the number of EM lattice bonds.

## 6. Free Connectors and Interaction Capacity

A key emergent idea:

- **Free connectors** represent the photon's capacity to interact:
  - Absorption/emission by matter.
  - Scattering and reconfiguration.
  - Entanglement and coupling to other field excitations.

With the current scheme:

- **Bare EM 4-loop**: 2 free connectors → baseline “vacuum interaction capacity.”
- **Single-shell photon**: 2 free connectors per shell 4-loop → similar order of capacity.
- **Multi-shell stacks**: more shells → more internal structure and additional free connectors across the stack → naturally reflecting higher total energy & interaction potential (more photons).

This is **qualitatively aligned with standard quantum theory**:
- More photons in the same mode → more total amplitude for interaction, not a single photon with a supercharged internal structure.

## 7. Open Design Questions (Recognized but Parked)

1. **Should the EM-field provide only 1 free connector per 4-loop instead of 2?**
   - Current choice: 2 free connectors.
   - Changing this would require rethinking:
     - The EM–photon coupling,
     - Or adding explicit vertical bonds to space (3-loop layer).
   - For now, we keep:
     - EM 4-loops with 2 free connectors,
     - To keep the EM layer structurally similar to a single shell.

2. **Explicit EM–space (4-loop–3-loop) vertical binding:**
   - One could imagine each EM 4-loop using one free connector to attach to a 3-loop (space).
   - But 3-loops already use their 6 connectors to tile the space lattice.
   - For now, **we avoid** complicating the 3-loop structure and treat the EM lattice as “residing in” space without explicit one-to-one vertical bonds.

3. **Precise pattern of which 4-loops in one shell bond to which 4-loops in the next shell:**
   - The exact graph of stack bonds between shells is still open.
   - We only assume:
     - 1 stack bond per 4-loop (except the top shell having no “up” bond),
     - Sufficient to maintain a connected, coherent stack.

4. **Phase, Spin, and Polarization on the Icosahedral Shell:**
   - We have not yet defined:
     - How the internal phase lives on the 12 4-loops of a shell.
     - How **helicity (spin ±1)** arises as a global twisting phase mode.
     - How polarization appears as the projection of these helicity modes.
   - These are planned as the **next steps** once the structural picture is stable.

---

## 8. Next Steps

- **Next conceptual focus:**
  1. Define phase on a single icosahedral shell (one photon).
  2. Identify allowed global standing-wave phase patterns.
  3. Show that two chiral modes (right/left twist) correspond to **photon helicities ±1**.
  4. Derive polarization (linear, circular) as observer-dependent superpositions of these helicity modes.

This file captures the current agreed structure so we can safely build spin and polarization on top of it in future sessions.
