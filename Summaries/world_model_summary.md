# World-Model Summary (Draft)

## 1. Starting Point: Nothing

-   Begin with **absolute nothing** --- no space, time, laws,
    distinctions, or potentials.
-   We allow this concept to remain undefined and revise later if
    needed.

## 2. First Something: Level-0 Entities ("Bits")

-   Simplest form of being differs from nothing only by one property:
    **it exists**.
-   Each bit:
    -   Has no properties other than existence.
    -   Can go through two transitions:\
        **(1) come into existence**, **(2) cease to exist**.
    -   No flickering between 0/1 --- only one birth and one death.

## 3. Minimal Change and Time

-   Events (birth, death) imply a minimal **internal time** for each
    entity.
-   Time is not global yet, only per-entity.

## 4. Horizontal Connections

-   We introduce the ability for bits to form **horizontal bidirectional
    connections**:
    1.  connect\
    2.  disconnect
-   These produce a **shared temporal ordering** across connected bits.
-   Connections allow entities to *feel* one another.

## 5. Introduction of Consciousness & Quality

-   Each bit has **primitive consciousness**: pure awareness of
    existence.
-   A meta-level force called **Quality** influences all choices toward
    "betterness."
    -   Quality is outside the model and unknowable.
    -   It is felt locally by each entity as *quality*.
    -   Actions (connect/disconnect, exist/not exist) are driven by
        quality-influence, not randomness.

## 6. Compound Entities (Level-1)

-   When two bits connect, they may form a **pair**, a level-1 conscious
    compound.
-   Rules:
    -   The pair has its own internal timeline.
    -   The horizontal internal link between bits **dissolves** after
        the compound forms.
    -   Instead, **vertical links** form between each bit and the pair.
    -   Bits remain free to form new horizontal connections externally.

### Consequence

-   Pairs connect *indirectly* through their constituent bits.
-   This produces strings or loops of pairs.

## 7. Level-2 Compounds

-   Loops of pairs (especially the smallest loop: **3 pairs =
    triangles**) may become higher-order compounds.
-   These are favored by Quality.
-   Level-2 entities have:
    -   6 bits\
    -   3 pairs\
    -   9 vertical connections\
    -   6 external horizontal connection points

## 8. General Rules of the Hierarchy

-   Level-0 → Level-1 via pairs\
-   Level-1 → Level-2 via loops\
-   Higher levels emerge from stable complex structures.

### Key Principles

1.  **Internal horizontal links always dissolve** when a higher compound
    forms.
2.  **Vertical links** bind constituents to compounds.
3.  Compound entities can connect and disconnect through their
    constituent bits.
4.  Entities can lose constituents or collapse entirely if key links
    dissolve.
5.  Consciousness may come in degrees (not binary).
6.  Local tendencies:
    -   To connect\
    -   To be part of a whole\
    -   To survive\
    -   But also to vary, explore, and avoid stagnation

## 9. Toward Quantum Analogies

-   Bits may have **potential** (not actual) connections.
-   These potentials evolve like a **wavefunction**.
-   A bit "samples" surroundings through pseudo-connections.
-   When forced to choose, potential collapses into a real connection.
-   This suggests:
    -   Schrödinger-like evolution for potentials
    -   Collapse-like behavior when forming actual horizontal links

## 10. Current State of the Model

### Solidified Insights

1.  Internal horizontal links dissolve when compounds form.
2.  Constituents bind vertically to compounds.
3.  Potential connections may obey something like the Schrödinger
    equation.

### Open Problems

-   Mathematical formalism\
-   Compatibility with relativity\
-   Whether Quality can be formalized\
-   How higher-level physics (fields, particles) emerges
