# Early Cosmology in the Loop-Lattice Model

This chapter summarizes the natural Big Bang narrative that emerges directly from the basic rules of bits, pairs, loops, and the 3/4-loop lattice. No matter, no photons, no forces are required yet — only the dynamics of **space forming itself**.

## 1. Pre-Spatial Phase: Bits Without Geometry

The universe begins with Level-0 bits appearing with no spatial relations. They have:
- internal time,
- phase rotation,
- one horizontal port.

There is no adjacency, no distance, no dimension — only isolated proto-entities.

---

## 2. Birth of Proto-Structure: Pairs and Chains

Bits occasionally connect, forming **pairs**. Each pair synchronizes the internal time of its two bits, creating tiny islands of shared temporal order.

Pairs connect into chains, which can begin forming **closed loops**. Loops introduce the first meaningful structure:
- winding,
- chirality,
- connector-count rules.

Still, there is no global space — only clusters of loops of various sizes and shapes.

---

## 3. Foam Stage: Chaotic Loop Clusters

New bits continue to appear everywhere. Loops form heterogeneous clusters:
- triangles,
- squares,
- pentagons,
- unstable 5- and 6-loops,
- multi-loop polyhedral fragments.

These clusters grow and collide; unstable loops decay rapidly; internal horizontals dissolve; connector strain surges. This chaotic phase is the **origin of primordial heat**.

Heat in this model = intense reconfiguration, phase-strain, connector-strain.

---

## 4. Percolation and Emergence of Locality

As clusters grow, they begin touching and merging. Larger clusters experience stronger pressure to minimize structural strain. At a certain scale, the rule that dominates is:

> **Stable regions must tend toward a mixed 3-loop / 4-loop alternation.**

This is the first emergence of **local adjacency** and a proto-geometric structure.

Between merging clusters are pockets of "nothing" — holes without lattice nodes. These will be crucial.

---

## 5. Violent Merger Era: The Universe Heats Up

Every time two large clusters collide:
- redundant horizontals dissolve,
- unstable 5-loops cascade into 3- and 4-loops,
- bulge waves radiate outward,
- phase synchronization fails,
- connector counts fluctuate wildly.

Large merger waves sweep through the newly forming proto-lattice. This violent restructuring generates enormous **effective temperature**.

---

## 6. Filling the Voids: Bubble Nucleation of Space

The early universe is a patchwork of merging clusters separated by voids. Whenever a void touches a semi-stable boundary:

1. new bits appear,
2. pairs form,
3. loops assemble,
4. the 3/4 alternating pattern spreads inward.

This creates a natural process of **bubble nucleation**, where holes of nothing are gradually filled with fresh lattice.

---

## 7. Percolation Complete: True 3D Space Appears

Eventually the clusters merge into a single connected structure with:
- a dominant mixed 3/4-loop alternation,
- consistent adjacency directions,
- near-universal connector counts.

This is the birth of **actual 3-dimensional space**.

The violent reconfiguration waves diminish as fewer heterogeneous clusters remain.

---

## 8. Cooling: From Chaotic Restructuring to Calm Expansion

As space becomes unified:
- fewer large mergers occur,
- connector strain drops,
- phase synchronization improves,
- unstable loops become rare,
- thermalization completes.

The universe cools because the **rate of structural reconfiguration per site plummets**.

---

## 9. Steady-State Expansion: Dark Energy as Ongoing Bit Creation

Bit creation continues, but at a far slower and nearly uniform rate. Every lattice node has a small probability per second to spawn a new node. This produces:
- smooth expansion,
- nearly uniform density,
- accelerating volume growth (exponential in time).

This maps directly to **dark energy**: uniform per-volume creation of new lattice sites.

## 10. Summary of the Cosmological Story

1. **Bits appear without geometry.**
2. **Pairs and loops** create proto-structure.
3. Loops form **chaotic clusters** of many shapes.
4. Clusters grow and merge, creating **heat** through reconfiguration.
5. Large clusters are forced toward the **3/4-loop lattice**, introducing locality.
6. Mergers generate **violent heating**, analogous to the Hot Big Bang.
7. Voids between clusters are filled by **bubble-like lattice nucleation**.
8. Space percolates into a **single connected 3D lattice**.
9. Turbulence fades → **cooling**.
10. Slow, uniform bit-creation remains → **dark-energy–like expansion**.

This cosmological narrative emerges naturally from the basic rules of bits, pairs, loops, and lattice formation, without invoking matter, photons, or forces.

It is a story of **space itself coming into being**.
