# World-Model Summary (Updated to Photon Phase Dynamics)
*Version: current*

This document summarizes all major results established so far in the development of the world‑model, including photons, polarization, frequency, and phase dynamics.

# 1. Level Structure

## **Level‑0: Bits**
- Fundamental “atoms” of existence.
- Each bit has:
  - **existence**
  - **internal time**
  - **internal phase** \(\phi \in [0,2\pi)\) that oscillates
- Phase evolves as:  
  \(\phi(t) = \phi_0 + \omega t\)

## **Level‑1: Pairs**
- Two bits form a pair through a horizontal connection.
- Internal horizontal dissolves → replaced by **vertical links** to the new compound.
- Pair inherits a **phase relation** from constituent bits.

---

# 2. Level‑2: Loops

## **3‑Loops**
- 3 pairs in a cycle → 6 bits.
- All internal horizontals dissolve → **exactly 6 connectors**.
- No twist, no chirality, no internal modes.
- Unique minimal Level‑2 object.
- 3-loops tile naturally into a 3D cubic grid → **Level‑3 space**.

## **Higher Loops (4‑loops, 5‑loops, …)**
- Can maintain some internal horizontals.
- More internal degrees of freedom, twisting, and shape variation.
- At Level‑4 these loops become **fields**.

---

# 3. Level‑3: Spacetime From 3‑Loops
- 3-loops connect via their 6 external connectors → **cubic lattice**.
- Physical space = grid of 3-loops.
- Microscopic movement = Manhattan geometry.
- Wave propagation = **Schrödinger-like evolution of virtual connections** → spherical waves at macro-scale.

---

# 4. Level‑4: Fields From Higher Loops

## **Fully Dissolved 4‑Loop = Photon Field**
- 8 connectors total.
- No internal horizontals.
- Highly flexible and wave‑supporting.
- Forms a background “ocean” of dissolved loops → **EM field**.
- Virtual connections propagate linearly → **superposition** works.

## **4‑Loops With 1 Internal Link → Matter Fields**
- Align with 3D grid (6 external connectors).
- Come in geometric types:
  - axis-aligned (1,0,0)
  - face-diagonal (1,1,0)
  - body-diagonal (1,1,1)
- Candidates for electron-/neutrino-/quark-like fields.

---

# 5. The Photon as a Bound Structure

## **Minimal photon particle = icosahedral shell**
- 12 dissolved 4-loops (12 vertices).
- 96 bits total.
- Each loop uses:
  - **5 connectors** tangentially,
  - **3 connectors** radially (inner/outer layers or field).
- A single icosahedral shell = **one quantum of light** with base energy \(E_0\).

## **Higher‑energy photons**
- Multi-layered icosahedral shells.
- Number of shells \(m\) gives total energy  
  \(E = m \cdot E_0\).
- Frequency \(\nu\) comes from **phase oscillation**, not shell count.

---

# 6. Phase, Frequency, and Waves

## **Internal Phase**
- Each bit and each dissolved 4-loop carries a phase.
- Phase coupling between loops is the origin of wave propagation.

## **Wave Propagation**
- Waves = **virtual connection amplitudes** propagating through the photon field.
- Update rule is linear (like Schrödinger):
  \[
    \psi_{t+1}(L) = \sum_{N} A_{LN} \psi_t(N) - B \psi_{t-1}(L)
  \]
- Spherical wavefronts emerge naturally.

## **Frequency**
- Defined by phase evolution rate:
  \[
    \phi(t) = \phi_0 + \omega t, \quad \nu = \omega/2\pi
  \]
- Photon frequency = the oscillation frequency of the **coherent phase pattern** across the bubble + field.

# 7. Polarization as Standing Wave Patterns

## **Standing Waves on the Icosahedral Shell**
- The 12 loops support global **phase patterns**.
- Polarization = which **standing phase wave** pattern the photon uses.

## **Two allowed transverse phase modes**
- For any propagation direction \(\vec{k}\):
  - Only **two** stable transverse modes survive.
  - These correspond to the two polarization states of light.
- Circular polarization = the two modes in quadrature.

No physical spinning of loops or shells occurs.

---

# 8. Wave–Particle Duality in the Model

### **Wave**
- Distributed phase pattern in the photon field (virtual connections).

### **Particle**
- Localized, real-bound icosahedral shell (or multi-shell bubble).
- Forms when virtual amplitudes concentrate enough to collapse into real connections.

Wave and particle are different organizations of the **same substrate**.

---

# 9. Key Predictions and Constraints

1. **Two and only two** low-energy transverse standing wave modes on the icosahedral shell.  
2. Frequency corresponds to **phase rotation**, not physical rotation.  
3. Photon energy proportional to frequency:  
   \(E = h \nu\) emerges from internal phase dynamics.  
4. Photons naturally behave as **bosons** (connectors allow overlap).  
5. EM waves propagate at **constant speed** because virtual connection updates are dispersionless in continuum limit.

---

# 10. Next Steps (for future threads)
- Formalize the phase coupling rule.
- Calculate the normal modes of the icosahedral shell.
- Show explicitly that only two transverse modes propagate.
- Extend to matter-like 4-loops (axis-, face-, body-diagonal).
