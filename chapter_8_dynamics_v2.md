# Chapter 8 — Dynamics, Interactions, and Effective Quantum Behavior

*Draft 1 (in-chat mode)*

## 1. Purpose of This Chapter
This chapter explains **how the unified 3/4-loop lattice evolves in time**, and how that evolution produces the behaviors we usually call:

- motion,
- forces,
- quantum waves,
- interference,
- superposition,
- the Schrödinger equation,
- and collapse.

No new physics entities are introduced here. Everything arises from:

1. **Local lattice update rules**
2. **Mixed-loop topology**
3. **Phase synchronization**
4. **The difference between virtual and real connections**

## 2. The Basic Principle of Lattice Dynamics
The unified lattice evolves through **local updates** in discrete steps of internal time.

At each update:
- Each loop synchronizes phase with its neighbors (subject to fixed offsets).
- Horizontal connections may form or dissolve depending on redundancy, twist, and Quality preferences.
- Matter-defects and photon-shells respond to these changes.

### 2.1 Real vs. Virtual Connections
- **Real connections**: actual horizontal bonds, persistent.
- **Virtual connections**: transient phase-coherence relations; allow waves, superposition, interference; collapse when converted into real connections.

## 3. Motion of Matter Defects: Inertia from Connectivity
Matter-defects move by dissolving real bonds behind and forming new ones ahead.

### 3.1 Inertia
The lattice resists reconfiguration → inertia.

### 3.2 Pilot-wave behavior
Virtual-connection field propagates ahead; the defect follows phase gradients.

## 4. Wave-Like Behavior: Virtual Connections

### 4.1 Spherical propagation in a cubic lattice
Dissolved-loop flexibility + averaging → emergent isotropy.

### 4.2 Linear superposition
Virtual connections overlay freely → interference.

### 4.3 Dispersive vs. nondispersive modes
Photons are nondispersive; matter waves can disperse.

## 5. Interference and Superposition
Multiple paths contribute multiple virtual-connection phases → constructive/destructive interference.

## 6. Collapse: Virtual → Real

### 6.1 When collapse occurs
When a lattice site must form a real bond and competing virtual paths exist.

### 6.2 Why collapse is nonlinear
Real bonds are exclusive → all alternatives vanish when one forms.

## 7. Forces as Lattice Biases

### 7.1 Bulging → gravitational-like
Connector-surplus regions bias phase-flow inward.

### 7.2 Twisting → electromagnetic-like
Opposite twists reduce redundancy → attraction; same twists compete → repulsion.

## 8. Effective Schrödinger Dynamics
Local update rules approximate a linear wave equation at large scales.
ψ is effective, not fundamental.

## 9. When the Continuum Limit Emerges
Continuum physics appears when distortions vary slowly relative to the lattice scale.

## 10. Summary
Dynamics arise from discrete lattice updates:
- Virtual connections → waves
- Real connections → particles
- Twist/bulge → forces
- Quantum mechanics → effective large-scale approximation
