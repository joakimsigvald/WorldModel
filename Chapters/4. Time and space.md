**As Level-2 loops accumulate and begin forming larger structures, they do not spread out into a pre-existing space. Instead, they create their own network of adjacencies. Such a network has no built-in edges or borders; it can extend indefinitely and even ‘close back’ on itself in ways that have no analogue in ordinary geometry.**

**Just as a simple ring closes into a cycle in one dimension, a sufficiently large network of loops may form a self-connected structure in three dimensions — vast, continuous, and without an outside. Nothing in the model prevents distant regions from being indirectly connected through many paths yet still admitting direct bonds that make the entire network topologically closed.**
