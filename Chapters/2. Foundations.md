# Chapter 2 — Foundations

## 2.1. A Universe from Nothing: The Principle of Maximal Simplicity
We are attempting to describe and explain the world we live in, beyond what current physics can tell us. Since we have no direct access to whatever lies beneath today’s theoretical frameworks, we must search for a new starting point in the dark and climb step by step back up into the light, where existing physics and experiments can judge whether we are on the right track.

The only honest way to attempt this is to start with minimal assumptions and add structure only when it is strictly necessary. We might fail to find such a path, but if we succeed we will have a seed for a new theoretical framework that might reach all the way up to our current understanding of the world and beyond.

One motivation for such an ambitious undertaking is that fundamental physics seems stuck. No widely accepted breakthroughs have appeared since the Standard Model was completed in the 1970's. We still have not unified the two great theories of the twentieth century—quantum mechanics and general relativity—and we have no accepted way to incorporate the most important phenomenon known to man, or any life form: consciousness.

If we want to understand the world from the ground up, we therefore begin by assuming nothing: no space, no geometry, no shared time, no laws, and no quantities. From this absence of structure, the task is to identify the simplest form of “something” we can allow to exist without smuggling in the very structures we intend to explain later.

To keep this starting point minimal, we introduce only a few assumptions:

1. **There exists more than one entity**, so the universe is not permanently trivial and can support the formation of structure.

2. **Each entity has an internal state that can change**, because without change there is no basis for dynamics or interaction.

3. **Entities can connect with each other**, allowing more complex systems to form over time.

These minimal commitments define the starting point of the model: a setting where the simplest possible “somethings” exist, that can change internally and interact with each other. Everything else—time, space, energy, and matter—must emerge from these basic ingredients.
## 2.2. Bits: The Fundamental Unit of Existence
Given our starting point — multiple entities that can change internally and connect — we now specify the simplest possible form such an entity can take. We call it a **bit**.  

A bit has three defining properties:
### 2.2.1. Internal time

A bit proceeds through a sequence of internal updates.  
This is the minimal requirement for persistence or identity across its own evolution. Without internal time, an entity cannot change, interact, or take part in larger systems.

---
### 2.2.2. The internal state of a bit

One might assume that the simplest state change is a flip between “on” (1) and “off” (0), and this intuition partly motivates the name “bit.”  
But building discreteness into the fundamental layer of the model is incompatible with several basic phenomena we aim to describe later.  
The simplest continuous internal variable is a phase defined modulo 2π, which may evolve irregularly but always remains bounded.

This avoids arbitrary rules while giving the bit a minimal internal dynamic.  
The phase is entirely internal; it does not imply motion or spatial behavior.

---
### 2.2.3. A single external connection point

Each bit can form at most one connection with another bit at a time.  
This connection has no direction and carries no geometric information; two bits are simply connected or not.

This is the simplest possible form of interaction. As we will see, when combined with the hierarchical relations we will introduce next, it is sufficient to generate surprisingly rich structure.

---
To prepare for later development, we refer to this most minimal stage — entities with internal time, internal phase, and the ability to connect — as **Level 0**: The lowest level of existence.

These three properties define the Level-0 bit. It is the smallest entity that can:
- exist through its own internal timeline,
- carry a minimal internal dynamic,
- and participate in constructing larger structures by forming pairs.
## 2.3. Synchronization
When two bits connect, their internal dynamics begin to interact.  
A bit’s internal phase may change irregularly, but a connection imposes mutual influence: each bit can sense the other’s current state, and each adjusts its updates accordingly. If their rhythms are too incompatible, the connection becomes strained.

The simplest and most stable pattern that two influencing phase-evolutions can settle into is a **regular, repeatable rhythm** with a **fixed frequency**. In this minimal setting, such rhythms take the form of a near-harmonic cycle with a well-defined update rate. Nothing in the model requires bits to exhibit this behavior on their own. Instead, it is a **collective effect of the connection itself**: synchronization pushes irregular patterns toward consistency.

Because synchronization is easier when rhythms are already compatible, bits with similar frequencies are statistically more likely to form a stable bond. One may imagine that such bits “see” each other more clearly. Beyond this tendency, the model offers no deeper mechanism for why particular bits connect: with no space, no forces, and no geometry at Level-0, bonding remains a primitive, unexplained event.

**Synchronization creates the first form of shared time.**
Before connection, each bit’s updates unfold along its own private timeline with no relation to any other. During connection, a consistent ordering emerges between the two update sequences. This shared timeline is purely relational and lasts only as long as the bond itself.

A bond breaks when the two bits can no longer maintain stable synchronization, or when one bit forms a new connection. Afterward, each bit resumes its independent evolution, losing the shared temporal structure established during the bond.

Over its lifetime, a bit may synchronize with many different partners.  
Each connection merges two previously independent timelines into a shared one, and when the bond dissolves, the bit carries forward the timing it adopted during that episode.  
As bits connect, separate, and reconnect in countless combinations, these merged timelines overlap and propagate through the population.  
In this way, many locally synchronized pairs collectively produce a broader, increasingly consistent temporal structure — the earliest precursor to a global notion of time.
## 2.4. Emergent Compounds: A new level of existence
Under certain conditions, when two connected bits form a highly synchronized and stable unit, a new entity may appear: a **compound**. This compound is not the two bits themselves, but an emergent structure that coexists with them on a higher level of existence. We call this compound a **couple**. Thus, two connected _bits_ on Level-0 may give rise to a unified _couple_ on Level-1.

Once the couple exists, it acquires its **own internal time and state**. Its state is an aggregate of its bits' states. The bits continue to have there own internal states and update rates, but they are now aligned with and constrained by the couple’s unified temporal structure.

With the emergence of the couple, each bit becomes internally bound to this new entity through a vertical relation that lets the couple act as a unified whole through its constituents. Once these vertical bonds take over the internal role of the former horizontal bond, that bond no longer adds anything useful and naturally dissolves. Freeing its connectors allows the bits to form new external bonds, so the couple has, in effect, two connectors and can form chains with other couples.

It is important to note that the only thing the couple can sense of the world outside itself is its two bits. The couple perceives and influences its surroundings only through them. So it is a useful simplification to say that the couple has two connector ports and can connect with other couples; in reality, only bits connect with bits.
## 2.5. Chains and Loops
**When couples form chains, they can take four logical forms:**
1. An **open chain**, where both ends have a free connector and the structure can be extended. 
2. A **semi-closed chain**, where one end is connected to a bit, such that no extension is possible from that end. 
3. A **fully closed chain**, where both ends are terminated by bits and no extension is possible. 
4. A **cyclic chain**, where the chain connects back onto itself and forms a ring."

**Only the fourth case is structurally significant.**  
A ring, being cyclically connected, imposes stronger synchronization pressures on its bits and couples than other chains do. If this heightened coherence can be achieved, the ring may stabilize into a level-2 entity: a **loop**.

When the loop emerges—with vertical bonds to its constituent couples—the horizontal bonds that held the ring together dissolve. The ring structure disappears, but the loop remains as a new unified entity with its own internal time and state, inherited from the coordinated activity of its constituent couples.

A loop is therefore not a ring-shaped object but a Level-2 subject whose internal organization is effectively a tree spanning three levels of existence:
* The root-node, the loop itself, resides on level-2
* The middle nodes, one for each couple, reside on level-1
* The leaf nodes, one for each bit, two per couple, reside on level-0

Although only bits connect directly at the fundamental level, we may speak of loops connecting to other loops whenever their constituent bits form bonds. This abstraction will be used throughout the rest of the book.
## 2.6. Loop Stability and Structural Tendencies
Structures tend toward minimal strain by dissolving redundant bonds and optimizing connector usage.  
This section explains the rules that determine whether a structure is stable, metastable, or collapses.  
These principles later govern which particles and fields can exist.

There are in principle an infinite amount of loops of different lengths. But since longer loops have more vertical bonds that might break and destabilize the entire structure, we assume that shorter loops are preferred by the selective pressure. In coming chapters we will focus on tho loop types in particular:
Loops with three couples: **3-loops**, and and loops with four couples: **4-loops**.
We assume that shorter loops than three is not preferable because they would have two couples double-connecting to themselves, which is structurally redundant.
## 2.7. Energy as Strain
Energy is defined as the total strain stored in a structure—both geometric strain in connectors and phase strain in synchronization.  
This section unifies kinetic, potential, and field‑like energy under one structural concept.  
It establishes how energy arises from configuration rather than being an independent quantity.
