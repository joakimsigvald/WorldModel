# Bits and beings: 
## How a universe could emerge from nothing

---
_Traces a path from absolute simplicity to the full richness of reality._  
Starting from entities with no space, no geometry, and no shared time, it shows how structure, matter, light, minds, and meaning can arise through nothing more than connection, synchronization, and the drive toward coherence.  
This is a story of how the world may build itself — level by level, subject by subject — until beings like us appear to ask how it all began.
