At Level-0, it is possible that bits are not the only kinds of proto-entities that arise spontaneously. Many other fluctuations may appear, but most do not stabilize, cannot synchronize, or fail to connect in ways that allow larger, enduring structures to form.

Out of all the countless possibilities that Level-0 might permit, bits seem to be the type of minimal beings that survive the selective pressures of coherence and eventually give rise to our particular world.

On every level, consciousness acts as a selective tendency that filters out unstable or noise-like configurations and favors structures that support coherence and new possibilities.

Consciousness is the tendency that guides systems toward the sweet spot between rigidity and chaos.  
On the lower levels, it resists chaos and brings order.  
On the higher levels, it transcends order and opens new degrees of freedom.
