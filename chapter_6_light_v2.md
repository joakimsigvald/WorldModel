# Chapter 6 — Light and the EM Sector of the Unified Field (Rewritten)

## 1. Purpose of This Chapter
This chapter describes **light** as it arises within the unified 3/4-loop lattice.  
Photons are not defects *within* the lattice (like matter), but **mobile shell structures** that propagate *through* the lattice.  
The chapter explains:

- the structure of the photon shell,  
- helicity and polarization,  
- stacking and bosonic behavior,  
- wave–particle duality,  
- propagation dynamics,  
- and the fundamental frequency limit.

## 2. The EM Sector: Dissolved 4-Loops
Some 4-loops in the lattice exist in a **dissolved state**, where all their internal horizontals have dissolved and all 8 external connectors are available.  
When part of the EM sector, a dissolved 4-loop uses:

- **6 connectors** for nearest-neighbor lattice bonds (±x, ±y, ±z),  
- **2 free connectors** for interactions and coupling to photons.

These nodes form the **medium** through which electromagnetic waves propagate and onto which photon shells can attach.

## 3. Photon Structure: A Mixed 3+4 Loop Shell

### 3.1 Fixed 12-Loop Shell
A photon is a **12-loop icosahedral shell** with a specific mixed composition:

- **Front pole:** 1 × 3-loop  
- **Front ring:** 5 × 4-loops  
- **Back ring:** 5 × 3-loops  
- **Back pole:** 1 × 4-loop  

This configuration is **fixed**: a photon always contains exactly 12 loops and spans six lattice sites.

### 3.2 Direction of Motion
Propagation is defined by the **4-loop–rich hemisphere**:

- 4-loops support more reconfiguration,  
- the front hemisphere is connector-flexible,  
- therefore the photon moves **toward** the 4-loop–rich side.

The 3-loop at the front apex adds rigidity but does not oppose the direction.

## 4. Stacking: Why Photons Are Bosons

Multiple photons can occupy the **same region** because:

1. Each shell uses **5 connectors** per loop for shell bonds.  
2. It uses **1 connector downward** (toward the EM node or the shell below).  
3. It uses **1 connector upward** (except the top shell).  
4. Enough free connectors remain for interaction.

**Exact accounting**:

- **Base shell:** 5 shell bonds + 1 down + 1 up + 1 free  
- **Middle shells:** 5 + 1 + 1 + 1  
- **Top shell:** 5 + 1 + 0 + 2  
- **Underlying EM 4-loop:** 6 lattice + 1 connection to stack + 1 free  

Because shells “remove as many connectors as they add,” **stacking does not enlarge the footprint** or block additional shells.  
This is the geometric reason photons behave as **bosons**.

## 5. Helicity and Polarization

### 5.1 Helicity
The icosahedral shell contains two **5-rings**, one near the front and one near the back.  
Helicity comes from **phase winding** around these rings:

- **+1 winding** → right-handed helicity  
- **−1 winding** → left-handed helicity  

Only these two global chiral modes are self-consistent with the ring structure.

### 5.2 Polarization
Inside each photon, phase forms **standing-wave patterns** on the 12-loop shell.

- Exactly **two transverse standing modes** exist.  
- These correspond to the two basic linear polarizations.  
- Circular polarization is a **quadrature combination** of the two modes.

Thus, helicity and polarization arise entirely from phase topology on the shell.

---

## 6. Wave Behavior: Virtual Connections
The EM sector supports **virtual connections**—temporary phase-coherence relations between dissolved 4-loops.

- Virtual connections propagate linearly.  
- They superpose freely, producing wave interference.  
- They generate spherical wavefronts despite the underlying cubic adjacency.

This is the model’s version of **classical EM waves**.

---

## 7. Particle Behavior: Real Connections
A photon “particle” forms when:

- virtual connections converge,  
- a 12-loop shell stabilizes,  
- and **real connector bonds** within the shell become permanent.

The distinction is:

- **Wave:** virtual connections in the EM medium  
- **Particle:** real icosahedral shell  
- **Collapse:** a local reconfiguration requiring real bonds, eliminating alternatives

This produces wave–particle duality naturally from connector dynamics.

---

## 8. Propagation in the Lattice

Although the lattice is cubic at small scales, EM propagation appears isotropic because:

- dissolved 4-loops flexibly support phase flow,  
- update rules are linear in the virtual regime,  
- cubic anisotropy averages out over multiple sites.

Thus macroscopic EM behavior is **spherical and nondispersive**.

## 9. Frequency and the Maximum Allowed ν

### 9.1 Frequency = Phase Rotation Rate
A photon’s frequency is the rate at which its internal phase winds around the shell.

Low-frequency behavior matches \(E = h\nu\).

### 9.2 Origin of the Maximum Frequency
Phase coherence must circulate around a **5-ring**.  
A full rotation requires at least **5 update steps**.  
Thus there exists a hard cap:

\[
\nu_{\max} = \frac{1}{5\,\Delta t}
\]

No photon can exceed this; above it, the shell cannot maintain coherence.

### 9.3 Implications for the Lattice Scale
Since the maximum possible EM frequency in nature is expected near the Planck frequency, the model implies:

- lattice update time: \(\Delta t \approx t_P\)  
- lattice spacing: \(a \approx l_P\)

Thus the EM sector’s discrete structure is **Planck scale**.

## 10. Extreme Photon Densities

### 10.1 Golden-Ratio Packing Gap
Icosahedral geometry and connector constraints produce a natural gap of size  
≈ **1/φ ≈ 0.61** (in lattice units) between maximally packed photon shells.  
This gap prevents photons from ever touching directly, even at saturation.

### 10.2 Photon-Gas Collapse
At extreme photon densities:

- EM nodes' free connectors saturate,  
- shell–lattice interactions overload,  
- and the region becomes dynamically unstable.

This produces collapse-like behavior and sets a maximum sustainable photon energy density.

## 11. Summary
Light in the unified lattice consists of:

- **Mixed 3+4-loop shells** forming 12-loop icosahedral photons,  
- **phase-winding modes** (helicity) and **standing-wave modes** (polarization),  
- **virtual connections** (waves) and **real shells** (particles),  
- a **maximum frequency** determined by 5-ring coherence limits,  
- **bosonic stacking** enabled by precise connector accounting,  
- and **density limits** arising from geometry and connector availability.

This chapter completes the picture of the EM sector and prepares the ground for Chapter 7, where embedded matter-like distortions are described in contrast to these mobile photon shells.
